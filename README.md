# Embeded_System_Design_II
This project based course is the culmination of the curriculum capstone experience for the Computer Engineering Technology program. 

This course will be focused around a project that includes:
 product ideation
 project/resource management techniques
 system level specification
 modeling
 partition and design
 team collaboration and communication
 best documentation practices
 industry level coding practices
 hardware and software co-design methodologies
 design reuse and intellectual property creation
 design verification and validation
 design sign-off

Students, upon successful completion of the course, will have an industry-like embedded system product design
experience, starting by developing the vision for a product, including the voice of the customer, and progress
through the phases to develop a complete product prototype with professional documentation. In addition the
students will: track and present their progress; participate in design and code reviews; demonstrate their product
and highlight product differentiation. At the end of the course students will give a formal presentation, product
demonstration, deliver professional documentation, go over lessons learned and suggest future improvements.
